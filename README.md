# Obsidian RPG clock Plugin

Use clocks for your RPG (like Blades in The Dark) in Obsidian.md

## How to use

Add markdown 
\`\`\`clock
Clockname:fill/total
\`\`\`

You can add multiple lines to add several clocks


\`\`\`clock
Searching:4/10
Items found:3/4
\`\`\`


## WIP

- use plugin settings
  - colors
  - aspect / size
- settings might be overrided by markdown notation (TODO: find the best way to do it)

- use mouse to interact with clocks:
  - click in an empty slice to fill up to it
  - click on a filled slice to unfill it
  - shift click on the clock to add more total slices
  - shift right click on the clock to remove total slices

- use commands to add a new clock without writing markdown
